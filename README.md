Hello Krakentom!
I was following your GarminSpotifyRemoteController and got to an issue that I need help with. When executing the build for device, I get this: "The terminal process failed to launch: Path to shell executable "C:\Users\xxx\Desktop\GarminSpotifyRemoteController-main\garmin\SpotifyEdge\java" does not exist." as I'm trying to save it on the Garmin folder, should I save it somewherelse?
